Hello, this is a github tutorial

We are using bash as the tool of focus in this tutorial.

This is the first file to be committed after the default Readme.md


THis is another line in demo.txt I am adding to simulate a conflict scenario

This conflict scenario will be in the same branch and will be solved by stashing the committed changes


Wheee! I'm adding lines in this text file.

How fun

Hello everyone


Chris is also adding more lines just because i want to create conflict
RAWR!

This is Arthur adding another line in this file.
